output_directory
++++++++++++++++
``<output_directory>`` is a **required** argument for ``marius_preprocess``. 
It is the directory where all the files created by ``marius_preprocess`` wil be stored.
``marius_preprocess`` will create this file if it does not exist.
``marius_preprocess`` outputs the following files to ``<output_directory>``.
For the preprocessing of supported datasets, ``<output_directory>`` also includes
the downloaded raw dataset.

==================  ============
File                Description
------------------  ------------
train_edges.pt      Contains edges for training set;

                    Should be set for ``path.train_edges`` in Marius configuration file
valid_edges.pt      Contains edges for validation set; 

                    Should be set for ``path.valid)edges`` in Marius configuration file
test_edges.pt       Contains edges for test set; 

                    Should be set for ``path.train_edges`` in Marius configuration file
node_mapping.txt    Contains 2 columns; 

                    The first column is all the original node IDs from raw data, the second column is all the remapped node IDs
rel_mapping.txt     Contains 2 columns; 

                    The first column is all the original relation IDs from raw data, the second column is all the remapped relation IDs
==================  ============

Each edge in ``train_edges.pt``, ``valid_edges.pt``, and ``test_edges.pt`` is stored
in the format of ``source relation destination`` on 1 row.
The 2 Node IDs and relation IDs are stored as 3 4-byte integers (or 8-byte integers
if the storage data type is set to int64). 

The source, relation and destination of edge ``i`` can be retrieved from 
``train_edges.pt``, ``valid_edges.pt``, and ``test_edges.pt``
files by reading 3 4-byte integers (or 8-byte integers if using int64 data type for storage)
at the offset in the file ``i * 3 * 4`` (or ``i * 3 * 8`` when using int64).

\-\-files
+++++++++
``--files`` is an **optional** argument for ``marius_preprocess``.
It should be a list of files containing custom dataset. It should not be used
at the same time when ``--dataset`` is used.

For example, the following command preprocesses the custom dataset composed of ``custom_train.csv``,
``custom_valid.csv`` and ``custom_test.csv`` and stores them into directory ``output_dir``.

::

 marius_preprocess output_dir --files custom_train.csv custom_valid.csv custom_test.csv

\-\-dataset
+++++++++++
``--dataset`` is an **optional** argument for ``marius_preprocess``. 
It can be one of the names of a Marius supported dataset. 
It should not be used at the same time when ``--files`` is used.
To see which datasets are supported by Marius, check out
:ref:`dataset` table.

\-\-num_partitions
++++++++++++++++++
``--num_partitions <num_partitions>`` is an optional argument for ``marius_preprocess``.
If this option is specified, the nodes of the input graph will be partitioned into ``<num_partitions>``.
The default value for ``<num_partitions>`` is one.

\-\-overwrite
+++++++++++++
``--overwrite`` is an **optional** argument for ``marius_preprocess``. If this option is set, then
the ``<output_directory>`` will be overwritten. Otherwise, ``marius_preprocess`` will treat the files
in ``<output_directory>`` with the same file names as the latest files for current run. When switching
from one dataset to another one, the converted data files of the previous dataset in same ``<output_directory>``
may be treated as the already-preprocessed data files for the current dataset if this option is not set.

\-\-generate_config <device>, \-gc <device>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
``--generate_config <device>, -gc <device>`` is an **optional** argument for ``marius_preprocess``.
If this option is set, ``marius_preprocess`` will generate a Marius configuration
file in the ``<output_directory>`` with all configuration parameters set to the recommended defaults if not 
explicitly defined.

The generated Marius configuration is for single-GPU setting by default if ``<device>`` is not set.
If other device, such as ``CPU`` or ``multi-GPU``, is required, users can just append the option after
``--generate_config``, e.g. ``--generate_config CPU``.

For example, the following example will set ``general.device=CPU`` in the Marius 
configuration file generated for dataset WordNet18 (``wn18_cpu.ini``).

::

 marius_preprocess ./output_dir --dataset wn18 --generate_config CPU

\-\-<section>.<key>=<value>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
``--<section>.<key>=<value>`` is an **optional** argument for ``marius_preprocess``.
When ``--generate_config <device>`` is set, ``--<section>.<key>=<value>`` can be used
to change the value of certain option in the Marius configuration file generated.
For example, the following example will set ``model.embedding_sze=256`` and ``training.num_epochs=100``
in the Marius configuration file generated for custom dataset composed of ``custom_dataset.csv`` (``custom_gpu.ini``).

::

 marius_preprocess ./output_dir --files custom_dataset.csv --generate_config --model.embedding_sze=256 --training.num_epochs=100

\-\-format <format>
+++++++++++++++++++
``--format <format>`` is an **optional** argument for ``marius_preprocess``.
This is the sequence of the source node, relation, and destination node appears on one row of the 
dataset file. ``<format>`` should be specified using a string composed of only ``s`` for source, 
``r`` for relation and ``d`` for destination.

For example, the following command shows the how to preprocess a dataset file 
storing edges in the sequence of source node, relation and destination node.

::

 marius_preprocess ./output_dir --files custom_dataset.csv --format src

\-\-delim delim, -d delim
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
``--delim=<delim>`` is an **optional** argument for ``marius_preprocess``.
``<delim>`` defines the delimiter between nodes and relations in the dataset files.
If ``<delim>`` is not set, ``marius_preprocess`` will use Python Sniffer to detect a delimiter.
The delimiter is printed to the terminal so users can verify it.

\-\-dtype <dtype>
+++++++++++++++++
``--dtype <dtype>`` is an **optional** argument for ``marius_preprocess``.
It defines the format for storing each node remapped ID and relation remapped ID. The current supported
format is ``int32`` and ``int64``. 
When storing in ``int32``, each remapped ID will be a 4-byte integer.
When storing in ``int64``, each remapped ID will be a 8-byte integer.
If the total number of nodes or relations is smaller than 2.1 billion,
it is recommended to choose ``int32`` to avoid unnecessary waste of space.
On the other hand, if the total number of nodes or relations is bigger than 2.1 billion,
it is recommended to choose``int64`` to ensure all IDs to be remapped.
The default ``<dtype>`` is set to ``int32``.

\-\-not_remap_ids
+++++++++++++++++
``--not_remap_ids`` is an **optional** argument for ``marius_preprocess``.
If this option is set, the remapped IDs of nodes and relations will be the same 
as the read-in order of the nodes and relations from original dataset.

\-\-dataset_split <validation proportion> <test proportion>, \-ds <validation proportion> <test proportion>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
``--dataset_split <validation proportion> <test proportion>, -ds <validation proportion> <test proportion>``
is an **optional** argument for ``marius_preprocess``.
It offers the user the option to split the dataset. By appending the proportion of validation
and test set out of total dataset, users can split the original dataset into training, validation,
and test sets. An exception would be raised if the sum of these two proportions exceeds or equal to one.
By default, ``marius_preprocess`` merges all dataset files and produce one training set containing all edges.

For example, the following command splits the ``custom_dataset.csv`` into training,
validation, and test sets with a corresponding proportion of 0.99, 0.05, and 0.05.

::

 marius_preprocess ./output_dir --files custom_dataset.csv --dataset_split 0.05 0.05

\-\-start_col <start_col>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
``--start_col <start_col>`` is an **optional** argument for ``marius_preprocess``.
This is the column to treat as the nodes/relations column in custom dataset files.
The next two columns will be treated as relations/nodes. Whether a column is treated
as a node column or relation column is defined by the ``<format>`` argument.
The default value for ``<start_col>`` is zero.

\-\-num_line_skip <num_line_skip>, \-nls <num_line_skip>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
``--num_line_skip <num_line_skip>, \-nls <num_line_skip>`` is an **optional** argument for ``marius_preprocess``.
It is the number of lines of headers to skip when reading the custom dataset files.
If this value is not set. ``marius_preprocess`` uses Python Sniffer to determine the number of header row.

.. _user_guide_marius_train:

marius_train
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command allows users to train a graph embedding model over the preprocessed data.
A Marius configuration file is required for this command. See :ref:`Configuration<user_guide_configuration>`
for full details of Marius configuration file.

This command can be called with:

::

    marius_train <config_file> [OPTIONS]

The available options:

::

    Train and evaluate graph embeddings
    Usage:
    marius_train config_file [OPTIONS...] [<section>.<option>=<value>...]

    -h, --help  Print help and exit.

The ``config_file`` is the Marius configuration file that includes all configuration
options for model architectures and training pipeline.

The configuration options can also be modified by passing ``--<section>.<key>=<value>``
to the end of the ``marius_train`` command.
Any parameter passed in the command line will override the value specified
in the configuration file. The details about ``<section>.<key>`` can be
found in :ref:`Configuration<user_guide_configuration>`. The following is an example
of overriding the decoder model to ``TransE`` and using ``config.ini`` as the configuration
file:

::

    marius_train config.ini --model.decoder=TransE

During the execution of this ``marius_train``, information about training progress
and model performance is printed to terminal. The output of the first epoch would be
similar to the following.

    --rel rel, -r rel     relation (edge-type), the original ID of a certain relation
    --rel_type rel_type, -rt rel_type
                            The direction of a certain relation

The ``<trained_embeddings_directory>`` is the directory ``data/`` created by ``marius_train``.
The ``<dataset_directory>`` is the directory containing the ``node_mapping.txt`` and ``rel_mapping.txt`` files.
The ``<k>`` controls the number of predicted node to output.

\-\-src
+++++++
``--<src>`` is an **optional** argument. It is the original node ID of source node.

\-\-rel
+++++++
``--<rel>`` is an **optional** argument. It is the original relation ID of the relation.

\-\-dst
+++++++
``--<dst>`` is an **optional** argument. It is the original node ID of destination node.

\-\-rel_type
``--<rel_type>`` is an **optional** argument. It only takes two values: ``lhs``, ``rhs``.
For prediction given source node and relation type, use relation type of ``lhs``, otherwise, use ``rhs``.


Given the source node, relation and other necessary arguments,
 ``marius_predict`` outputs the top-five destination nodes
in the following example.

::

    marius_predict ./data/ ./dataset_directory 5 -s source_node_id -r relation_id --rel_type lhs
